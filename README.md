1) What is a programming language? What is Java and what is Java used for?

Programming language:

In a simple word programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. • The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages. 
A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Examples are: Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, BASIC, COBOL,FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.Programming languages are used to write all computer programs and computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something. such as .

What is Java:

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based and object-oriented. The programming language is structured in such a way that developers can write code anywhere and run it anywhere without worrying about the underlying computer architecture. It is also referred to as write once, run anywhere (WORA).This means Java code compiled once can be run on all platforms that run Java Runtime Environment without the need for recompilation.

Java was developed inside Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle) by James Gosling. It was developed to be similar to C++ and shares a lot of syntax with it. Java, currently maintained by Oracle, receives regular updates to accommodate the evolving needs of the developer community.

What is Java Used for?
Java can be used to build applications for a wide range of platforms. Desktops, servers, mobile phones, tablets, Blu-ray players, televisions, and web browsers all use Java, and developers can write Java-based applications for any of these platforms. Since Java adheres to WORA requirements, the same code can be run on all the platforms having Java Runtime Environment (JRE) without recompiling the code.

Java is used to write applications for different platforms that run JRE and supports applications that run on a single device like a desktop or mobile phone. Java can also be used to develop applications that work in a distributed manner. That means the same application can be distributed between servers or clients in a network and can be executed synchronously. Java can also be used to write application modules or applets as part of web pages.

Java is used for:

GUI applications
Web servers and applications servers
Middleware applications
Web applications
Mobile applications
Embedded systems
Enterprise applications.



2)Which version of Java you are working with? How can you find out the version of Java you are using?

3)What is IDE? Which IDE you are working with?

The IDE( Integrated Development Environment) is an application that makes programming easier!

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.

IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

Editing Source Code
Writing code is an important part of programming. We start with a blank file, write a few lines of code, and a program is born! IDEs facilitate this process with features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete.

Syntax Highlighting
An IDE that knows the syntax of your language can provide visual cues. Keywords, words that have special meaning like class in Java, are highlighted with different colors.

Compare these two code samples:

// without syntax highlighting

public class NiceDay {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("It's a nice day out!");
  }
}
// with syntax highlighting

public class NiceDay {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("It's a nice day out!");
  }
}
Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read by visually clarifying different elements of language syntax.

Autocomplete
When the IDE knows your programming language, it can anticipate what you’re going to type next!

We’ve seen statements with System.out.println() quite a bit so far. In an IDE, we might see System as an autocomplete option after only typing Sy. This saves keystrokes so the programmer can focus on logic in their code.

Autocompleting a command

Building Executables
Java is a compiled language. Before programs run, the source code of a .java file must be transformed into an executable .class by the compiler. Once compiled, the program can be run from the terminal.

This compilation process is necessary for every program, so why not have the IDE do it for us? IDEs provide automated build processes for languages, so the act of compiling and executing code is abstracted away, like in Codecademy lessons.

Debugging
No programmer avoids writing bugs and programs with errors.

When a program does not run correctly, IDEs provide debugging tools that allow programmers to examine different variables and inspect their code in a deliberate way.

IDEs also provide hints while coding to prevent errors before compilation.

Catching a bug

Coding On Your Computer
The biggest benefit to using an IDE is that it allows you to code and run Java programs on your own computer. We recommend IntelliJ IDEA, which you can download for macOS, Windows, or Linux.

You should download and install Java to your computer before using an IDE.


4)What is source code? What is file extension for Java source code?

Source code is the fundamental component of a computer program that is created by a programmer. It can be read and easily understood by a human being.In computing, source code is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.
